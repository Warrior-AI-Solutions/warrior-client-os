# Skill 1 — Product Discovery

> **"What should we build?"**
> Transform a client's pain into a precise, investable product brief.

## Status: 🟡 Spec In Progress

The vision is defined. The full session structure needs to be built out.
See `CLIENT-OS.md` for the complete vision. This README tracks Skill 1 specifically.

## Purpose

Most clients come to us knowing they have a problem. Very few know exactly what to build. Skill 1 closes that gap.

By the end of a Skill 1 session, we know:
- **Who** has the problem (avatar — specific, not generic)
- **What** the problem costs them today (in time, money, or quality)
- **What** the product needs to do (jobs to be done, not features)
- **What** the market looks like (how many clients could benefit)
- **What** the ROI looks like (the number that justifies the investment)
- **What** we are NOT building (anti-product — prevents scope creep)

This output becomes the input for Skill 2.

## Outputs

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `product-brief.md` | One-page summary of everything above |
| `avatar.md` | Detailed description of the target user |
| `roi-model.md` | Spreadsheet-style ROI calculation |
| `jobs-to-be-done.md` | The specific tasks the product will perform |

## Session Design

*Full session agenda: TBD*

**Planned sections:**
1. Company Context — industry, size, current tech stack
2. Pain Point Deep Dive — what breaks, what's manual, what's avoided
3. Desired State — what perfect looks like in 12 months
4. Avatar Definition — who specifically uses this
5. Market Sizing — how many companies have this problem
6. ROI Calculation — what is the measurable value
7. Anti-Product — what this is NOT
8. Competitive Landscape — what exists, why it's not enough

## Sessions Log

| Date | Client | Output | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|

## Open Questions

- How long should a Skill 1 session be? (Target: 1.5–2 hours)
- Should the ROI model be built during the session or after?
- How do we handle clients who don't know their numbers? (time saved, error rate, etc.)
- At what point in Skill 1 do we introduce pricing expectations?

*Add session outputs to `sessions/` after each engagement.*
